# Ledger Pal
### A good friend who keeps the ledger for you!

* ### Ledger?
a book of your income and outcome. it basically has all the records of your earnings
and expenses. It might have transaction records of multiple accounts,
and you can explain to your future self (presumably very mad, because of all the 
expensive stuff you bought) that it was very good choice to a lotta money on
some irrelevant crypto-coin!

* ### What does it do?
first you sign up, like every other website! then you get to save info of your different 
account, and if you don't have time for it, you can record all of your 
transactions on you default account. then it's pretty easy: every time
you get paid, enter the data. every time you spend money, enter the data again.
you can create categories for your expenses, you can add description to your transactions,
and of course you can set alarm for a specific account or category of expenses.
